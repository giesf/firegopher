        <h1 id="advanced-usage-known-limitations">Advanced Usage &amp; Known Limitations</h1>
<h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
<p>The current state of the networking stack should be considered unstable. Every time you run a new microVM firegopher creates a new tap device and assigns it an unused IP from the range <code>172.19.0.0/16</code>. </p>
<p>This is somewhat wasteful as this results in creating a lot of dangling network devices and assigned IPs. You are currently responsible for cleaning them up. </p>
<p>There is currently no way of predefining a static IP for a microVM.</p>
<h2 id="base-images">Base images</h2>
<p>Currently the only officially supported base image is a slightly modified version of <a href="https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/minimal/releases/jammy/release/">Ubuntu 22.04 Minimal</a> for demo purposes.</p>
<p>You can create your own base image to be used with firegopher by following the process <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/rootfs-and-kernel-setup.md#creating-a-rootfs-image">outlined by the Firecracker team here</a> and placing the resulting <code>imagename.ext4</code> file in <code>/srv/firegopher</code>. Afterwards you can use the base image by running firegopher with the flag <code>--baseImage=imagename</code>.</p>
<h2 id="persistent-storage">Persistent storage</h2>
<p>Currently you can only run firegopher with a single persistent volume that is always mounted to <code>/data</code>.</p>
<p>Right now you are responsible for creating a image file to back that volume and provide it through the dataVolume flag (e.g. <code>--dateVolume=volume.img</code>).</p>
<h2 id="firegopher-should-be-considered-unstable-and-unfit-for-production-use-cases">Firegopher should be considered unstable and unfit for production use-cases</h2>
<p>In addition to the lacking testing infrastructure <strong>this project currently does not implement the basic security and performance considerations needed to run Firecracker in production.</strong> </p>
<p>This is due to the fact that it was created as a proof of concept in the context of a university project at <a href="https://code.berlin">CODE UAS Berlin</a>. </p>
<h3 id="firecracker-production-host-recommendations">Firecracker production host recommendations</h3>
<p>Currently firegopher does not implement <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/prod-host-setup.md">the production host setup recommendations that the AWS Firecracker team has provided in their git repo</a>. </p>
<h3 id="memory-usage">Memory usage</h3>
<p>Firecracker has the habit of eating up as much ram as it can get its hands on without returning it to the system. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36667792">You can read a Hacker News thread discussing this here</a>.</p>
<p>An option for dealing with this is <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/ballooning.md">using a memory baloon device with Firecracker</a>, which firegopher currently does not do. </p>
